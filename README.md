## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Source**: SuperStore transactional database (2019-2022)
- **Records**: 9,994 orders, 793 customers, 1,862 products
- **Frequency**: Daily extracts with incremental refresh
- **Validation**: Automated data quality checks on load

### Analysis Approach

**1. RFM Segmentation**
- Recency: Days since last purchase (quintiles)
- Frequency: Number of orders (quintiles)
- Monetary: Total spend (quintiles)
- Combined score creates 125 potential segments, grouped into 4 strategic segments

**2. Profitability Attribution**
```
Net Profit = Revenue - Product Cost - Shipping Cost - Discount - Returns
Contribution Margin = Revenue - Variable Costs
Profit Margin % = Net Profit / Revenue
```

**3. Geographic Analysis**
- State-level profitability calculation
- Shipping cost attribution by distance and zone
- Regional benchmarking against best performers

**4. Product Portfolio Matrix**
- Revenue vs Profit margin classification
- Market share analysis by category
- SKU rationalization based on contribution margin

### Assumptions
- Customer retention rate: 70% baseline
- CLV discount rate: 10% annually
- Shipping zone assignments based on ZIP code centroids
- Discount impact calculated on gross margin basis

### Limitations
- Historical data only (no predictive modeling yet)
- External factors (economy, competition) not included
- Assumes current pricing structure remains constant
- Shipping costs based on list rates (actual may vary)
